# Project Nexus Documentation

Welcome to **Project Nexus**, a comprehensive documentation repository for major backend engineering learnings from the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.

This repository serves as a centralized hub to consolidate key concepts, tools, real-world challenges, and best practices acquired throughout the program. It also aims to foster collaboration between backend and frontend learners to simulate real-world development environments.

---

## Project Objective

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program.
- Document major backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and implemented solutions.
- Serve as a reference guide for current and future learners.
- Foster collaboration between frontend and backend learners for practical project experience.

---

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered
- **Python**
- **Django**
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
- **GraphQL**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)**
- **Celery & RabbitMQ**

### Core Backend Development Concepts
- **Database Design & Optimization**
- **Asynchronous Programming (AsyncIO, Celery)**
- **Caching Strategies (Redis, Memcached)**
- **Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth)**
- **System Design Principles**
- **API Versioning & Pagination**

---

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Designing scalable APIs | Implemented RESTful and GraphQL APIs using DRF and Graphene |
| Asynchronous task handling | Used Celery with RabbitMQ for background job processing |
| Deployment complexities | Containerized applications using Docker and automated workflows with GitHub Actions |
| Caching performance issues | Integrated Redis for optimized data retrieval |
| API security | Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based access controls |

## Best Practices & Takeaways

- Maintain **clean and modular code architecture**.
- Use **environment variables** and `.env` files to secure sensitive data.
- Apply **test-driven development (TDD)** to ensure code reliability.
- Ensure **API documentation** (Swagger, Postman) is up-to-date for frontend integration.
- Embrace **CI/CD workflows** to streamline development and deployment.
- **Version control** is criticalâ€”commit often and with meaningful messages.
